Make sure to consider location, especially for Ph.D. programs, because you'll be there for a while, and it's important to only apply to schools that have research you're genuinely excited by. I would also ensure that each school you apply to has at least 2-3 PIs you'd be interested in working with, just in case of lack of funding, incompatible working styles, etc. Some PIs may explicitly state on their websites whether they are recruiting students in the current application cycle.",

I also wouldn't worry about trying to email all the advisors you're applying to. Start with your top few, and if you have time, you can always reach out to more. Here are some tips for emailing potential PIs. If you do decide to send out emails, don't stress if you don't get a response ‚Äî remember, all faculty are extremely busy people!",

This is where you have the opportunity to share your research interests and tell your story as a researcher. One of the most helpful pieces of advice I received while writing my SOP is to have a mission statement, or some sort of unifying message that ties together your research experiences into a cohesive narrative. There\'s no "right" way or standard template for writing SOPs, but it can help to look at some examples when getting started. Here is one example that I found particularly helpful, and definitely reach out to your friends, mentors, and professors too.',
